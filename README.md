### The Bookmarking Tool that Does it All

- Save Anything from the Web
- Clip articles, photos, videos, PDFs, and pages from the web.
- Thematic collections suggested tags and custom filters.
- Sort items by date, title, site, or manually by drag-drop.

Kairy is about giving you a place to capture and collect the things you find all across the web that fascinate you. A space that is yours, filled with what interests you. With our latest version, weâ€™ve created a calmer, cleaner corner of the internet for you to enjoy each day.

**The goals of this project are summarized here:**

- Make the browser start page dark (or light, or anything in between).
- Do not access user information. This means Kairy will not request browser permissions.
- Aim to make everything on the user interface, within reason, customizable.
- Aim to make the user experience easy while supporting the above.
- Keep Kairy open source.

### Tech stack used:

- React and Typescript for Frontend
- Scss for styling
